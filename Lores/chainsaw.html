                    <p>
                        In this world, Devils are born from human fears. Devil Hunters specialize in hunting them and who often make contracts with them in exchange for power. Set in 1997, an alternate timeline where the Soviet Union still exists, the demise of a devil erases the fear associated with it from human memory; the Holocaust, AIDS, and nuclear weapons were collectively forgotten.<br><br>

                        <b>Part 1: Public Safety Arc</b><br>
                        Denji is a teenager trapped in poverty, working off his deceased father's debt to the yakuza by working as a Devil Hunter, aided by Pochita, his canine companion and Chainsaw Devil. Denji is betrayed by the yakuza, who kill him for a contract with the Zombie Devil. Pochita makes a contract with Denji, merging with him as a Devil-human hybrid, under the condition that Denji live out his modest dreams of living a basic life such as having bread with jam, or falling in love with a woman and being intimate with one. By pulling on a cord in his chest, Denji then becomes Chainsaw Man and massacres the yakuza.<br><br>

                        In the aftermath, Denji joins a team of governmental Devil Hunters, the Public Safety Division, led by Makima, who assigns him to kill the Gun Devil. After being paired with a more experienced Devil Hunter named Aki Hayakawa, Denji begins training with his partner, Power the Blood Fiend, under the veteran Devil Hunter Kishibe. Together, they fight several enemies who seek Denji's power, including the yakuza, other Devils, and assassins sent by various countries.<br><br>

                        Makima is later revealed to be the Control Devil, who is ultimately seeking to control Pochita, as he has the power to erase concepts from existence by consuming their Devils. The Gun Devil—whose body had secretly been divided among several countries as a superweapon—is sent by the United States to kill Makima, but she defeats it, forcing it to enter Aki's body as the Gun Fiend, whom Denji kills in self-defense. Makima later kills Power in front of Denji, rendering him catatonic and forcing Pochita to take over his body.<br><br>

                        Kishibe organizes a raid to rescue Denji alongside cowardly Public Safety operative Kobeni Higashiyama. With their help and the last of Power's blood, Denji kills Makima. Some time later, Kishibe places the reborn Control Devil—a little girl named Nayuta—in Denji's care. In a dream, Pochita thanks Denji for showing him his dreams, and encourages him to live his life to the fullest. Denji begins attending high school while also fighting Devils as a vigilante.<br><br>

                        <b>Part 2: School Arc</b><br>

                        Asa Mitaka, an introverted high school student who has trouble finding her place in society following her mother's death at the hands of the Typhoon Devil, makes a contract with the War Devil, Yoru, in order to save her life. Yoru inhabits Asa's body under the condition that they kill Chainsaw Man. After defeating the Typhoon Devil, Asa seeks to end her contract with Yoru, while Yoru seeks to use Asa's body to resurrect the Nuclear Weapons Devil.<br><br>

                        Meanwhile, Denji is attending the same school as Asa, while trying to raise Nayuta and use his newfound fame as Chainsaw Man to attract women. However, his classmate, Devil Hunter Hirofumi Yoshida, blocks Denji's attempts to reveal his alter-ego while keeping tabs on him for the government. Yoshida introduces Asa to Denji, who admits to being Chainsaw Man, but Asa does not believe him. Meanwhile, a mysterious impostor Chainsaw Man stalks the streets, killing Asa's friend Yuko.<br><br>

                        After surviving a trap set for them by the Famine Devil, Fami, at an aquarium, Yoru tries to transform Denji into a weapon through Asa's body, but fails. As Asa feels rejected by different boys she trusted, the Falling Devil appears, trying to cook her into a meal. Denji, as Chainsaw Man, along with the impostor, appears and helps her escape, with Fami and Nayuta manipulating events in the background. Asa becomes attracted to Chainsaw Man after realizing he has saved her life multiple times. Fami wants Yoru to survive for the sake of changing the Prophecy of Nostradamus and protecting humanity from the appearance of Death Devil, but Nayuta is more concerned with childish things like wanting to attend school and eat snacks. During the aftermath of Falling Devil's attack, Denji, Nayuta and their dogs are captured by Yoshida's organization, as the supporters of Chainsaw Man form the Chainsaw Man Society for World Peace led by Haruka Iseumi of the Devil Hunter Club. Yoshida threatens to kill Nayuta if Denji ever transforms into Chainsaw Man again, since the conflict between the supporters and critics of Chainsaw Man is escalating.<br><br>

                        A conflicted Denji chooses to protect the normal life he has and decides to quit being Chainsaw Man. The Chainsaw Man Society for World Peace, who are revealed to be working for Fami, reveals a mysterious character as the Chainsaw Man, much to the dismay of Denji. Fami reveals that Yoru's goal of killing Chainsaw Man and Asa's desire to save him are both achievable, as there are two entities known as Chainsaw Man- the "red" one that is Denji and the object of Asa's affections, and the former form of Pochita, the "black" one, that has consumed the Nuclear Weapons Devil and is the object of Yoru's revenge. Meanwhile, Denji encounters Miri Sugo, the Longsword hybrid who had previously fought Denji while Pochita was controlling his body. Miri attempts to convince Denji to join the Chainsaw Man Church, but fails. Later, when the Church attempts an attack on the public, they are intercepted by Quanxi and Katana Man, the Bow and Katana hybrids whom Denji had also previously fought. However, Barem Bridge, the Flamethrower hybrid and another member of the Church, reveals that the members of the Chainsaw Man Church had been mass-contracted with the Fire Devil, allowing them to become devils in the likeness of Chainsaw Man; this would cause a war that would greatly increase public fear of both Chainsaw Man and Yoru, strengthening them enough to fight the Death Devil. Quanxi saves Denji, Nayuta, and fellow student Fumiko Mifune from the Church, taking them to Public Safety Officials who states that the devils can be killed via cremation. Asa and Yoru, meanwhile, are confronted by Yoshida who is leading a raid to kill the War Devil. Yoshida hesitates in killing her, allowing for Asa and Yoru to escape. At the same time, Asa and Yoru learn that due to the increasing fear of wars, their power has now increased and they can now make weapons without coming in physical contact with the object. Meanwhile, Denji attempts to return to his normal life, but Barem, who had escaped Public Safety, burns down his apartment, incinerating Nayuta's pet dogs and Power's cat in the process. Shattered, Denji transforms into Chainsaw Man, and attacks Barem and Miri. Nayuta apparently sacrifices herself to save Denji, who is taken by Yoshida and Fumiko.<br><br>

                        With no use left for Denji, Public Safety imprisons him at the Tokyo Devil Detention center, and uses his body for amputations. A week later, Asa, Yoru, and Fami free Denji from the Devil Detention Center, and are joined by Haruka, Seigi Akoku and Nobana Higashiyama, the Church's followers who are now being treated as international terrorists, as well as Katana Man and the Nail Fiend. Denji joins the group on the condition that the group shall first attempt to find Nayuta, who has gone missing. Later, at a restaurant, the group encounters Barem, who shows Denji what appears to be Nayuta's severed head. With Denji now sufficiently broken, Pochita takes over his body once more. As Pochita goes on a rampage, he consumes several Devils, erasing their concepts from the world. With the help of the newly introduced Aging Devil and Yoshida's abilities, Public Safety confirms that they can restore erased concepts by making Chainsaw Man vomit the devils that he ate. Public Safety, along with the Japanese Government, decides to go into a contract with the Aging Devil where in exchange for killing 10,000 children, the Aging Devil would voluntarily let itself be consumed by Chainsaw Man, erasing the concept of Aging. Pochita then erases the concepts of Snow, Octopus, Bitterness, and Mouth by eating their respective devils. Yoru, Katana Man, and the Aging Devil attack Pochita, but are defeated and lose their arms. Yoru then turns her "children", the Tank and Gun Devils, into weapons. Pochita retreats in search of blood to heal himself.<br><br>
