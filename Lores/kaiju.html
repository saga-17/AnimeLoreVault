                    <h2><b><u>Plot:</u></b></h2>
                    <p>Kaiju No. 8 is set in a world in which monsters named kaiju regularly cause disasters. Japan has the highest rate of kaiju attacks in the world, therefore in order to combat them it establishes the Anti-Kaiju Defense Force. Kaiju are assigned a "fortitude level"—a scale indicating their overall strength, and are classified as honju—more dangerous, stronger kaiju, and yoju—smaller kaiju that can accompany or sprout off from honju. Kaiju that have high fortitude levels or abnormal characteristics are given a number as an identifier based on when they first appear, and are classified as daikaiju.<br><br>

                        Defense Force officers wear powered suits made from kaiju remains that grant them increased strength, speed, and durability. The suits have a total power output, measured in the form of a percentage (referred to as "unleashed combat power"), which varies from person to person (depending on their ability), with a maximum of 100%. The suits also influence how strong an officer's weapons are.<br><br>
                        
                        Daikaiju remains are used to create stronger weapons named Numbers that are named after the daikaiju they are made from, but only a select few can use them if they are deemed compatible. Numbers weapons are much stronger than regular suits and provide their users with special abilities. The Defense Force consists of field officers led by platoon leaders, with varying levels of unleashed combat power, and captains and vice-captains whose combat power exceeds 90% and who lead divisions. Field officers are supported by a team of operators who provide information on kaiju, and monitor the field officers' health and suit output.<br><br>
                    
                        After their town is destroyed by kaiju, childhood friends Kafka Hibino and Mina Ashiro both vow to become members of the Defense Force to fight kaiju together. Mina, now 27, has since become the captain of the Defense Force's Third Division while Kafka, now 32, has failed the examination numerous times and works as a member of a clean-up crew that disposes of kaiju remains after battle. Kafka meets a young part-time worker in his company, Reno Ichikawa, an aspiring Defense Force member, who reignites his desire to become part of the Defense Force. However, a parasitic creature enters Kafka's body through his mouth and he gains the ability to turn into a kaiju. After escaping from the Defense Force, Kafka is given the code name "Kaiju No. 8" and decides to apply while keeping his kaiju form a secret.<br><br>

                        Kafka and Reno pass the exam and join the Third Division along with Kikoru Shinomiya, a kaiju-slaying prodigy who Kafka saved during the test from a humanoid kaiju which the Defense Force names "Kaiju No. 9". Kafka encounters No. 9 once more when it tries to kill Reno during their first mission with the Third Division. Kafka fails to kill No. 9 and as he tries to hide he is attacked by the vice captain of the Third Division, Soshiro Hoshina. After a short fight, Kafka escapes from the vice captain, still maintaining his cover. However, Kafka is eventually forced to reveal his kaiju form when he transforms in front of the Third Division to save its base in Tachikawa from destruction after it is attacked by another humanoid kaiju named Kaiju No. 10.<br><br>

                        Kafka is, reluctantly, apprehended by Mina and sent to Defense Force headquarters where he is given a chance to prove his usefulness after he defeats the Director General of the Defense Force, and Kikoru's father, Isao Shinomiya, in a duel. Kafka and Kikoru join the First Division led by captain Gen Narumi where they again fight No. 9 who attacks Shinagawa. Although the group kills two decoy versions of No. 9, the real one attacks Isao and absorbs him and his Numbers 2 weapon, a powered suit of armor created from the remains of Kaiju No. 2, with which it becomes stronger. No. 9 escapes and prepares for an invasion of Japan. Kafka and Kikoru train for the invasion with Kikoru gaining her mother's Numbers 4 weapon. Reno gains the Numbers 6 weapon and trains with the Fourth Division.<br><br>

                        Several months later, No. 9 begins its invasion of Japan, sending a group of kaiju identified as Kaiju Nos. 11 - 15 that attack Gen, Soshiro, Kafka, Mina and Kikoru respectively. After some struggle, Gen, Soshiro, Kafka, and Kikoru succeed in defeating their opponents with Mina being the last one to defeat hers. However, No. 9 uses the corpse of Kaiju No. 14 as a portal to close the distance between itself and Mina, revealing its plan to kill and absorb Mina in order for it to gain her highly destructive ability that makes her an important part of the Defense Force. Kafka tries to reach Mina but is stopped by numerous kaiju controlled by No. 9. However, Reno arrives to clear a path for Kafka who manages to reach Mina before she is absorbed by No. 9. Kafka and No. 9 begin their battle.
