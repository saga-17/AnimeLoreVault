                    <h2><b><u>Plot:</u></b></h2>
                    <p>Izuku "Deku" Midoriya is a teenage boy who dreams of becoming a Hero, despite being bullied by his childhood friend Katsuki "Kacchan" Bakugo for lacking a Quirk. After an encounter with his idol, All Might, who is the world's greatest hero, Midoriya is chosen by All Might to inherit his Quirk "One For All"—which gives him the ability to stockpile his raw power and pass it on to others—and become his successor, as All Might was severely injured by his arch-nemesis All For One, whose Quirk allows him to steal other Quirks for his use and pass them over to others at his will. Midoriya passes the entrance exam to U.A. High School, a school for heroes, by saving Ochaco Uraraka, and is placed in Class 1-A alongside Bakugo and Uraraka. During one of their classes, Class 1-A encounters the League of Villains, led by All For One's apprentice Tomura Shigaraki.<br><br>

                        Midoriya and his classmates Shoto Todoroki and Tenya Ida defeat the villain Stain, who believes most heroes only desire fame. Stain's ideology spreads, and many of his believers join the League of Villains, including serial killers Dabi and Himiko Toga. The League of Villains' recruits ambush Classes 1-A and 1-B, and kidnap Bakugo. All Might and other heroes track down the League of Villains' hideout, where All For One reveals himself. Midoriya and his friends rescue Bakugo as All Might battles All For One. All For One is defeated and imprisoned, while All Might exhausts the last of One For All's power and retires.<br><br>
                        
                        Midoriya begins an internship with All Might's former sidekick Sir Nighteye. After Sir Nighteye is killed during a raid on the Shie Hassaikai yakuza group, Midoriya continues his internship under Todoroki's estranged father Endeavor, who assumed All Might's position as Japan's top hero following his retirement. Midoriya later awakens all of the Quirks initially used by the previous users of One For All.<br><br>
                        
                        The League of Villains defeats and merges with another villain group, the Meta Liberation Army, forming the Paranormal Liberation Front. The pro and training heroes attempt to arrest the Paranormal Liberation Front, but most of its top members escape, including Shigaraki, who now inherits All For One's Quirk and is possessed by him. Uraraka develops sympathy for Toga after witnessing the latter cry. Dabi reveals himself as the presumed-dead son of Endeavor, whose abuse led him to villainy, shattering the public's trust in heroes. Thousands of imprisoned Villains break out, including the original All For One, descending Japan into chaos. Midoriya leaves U.A. to hunt for All For One with Japan's top heroes. However, his single-minded focus drives him to physical ruin. Midoriya's classmates bring him back to U.A., which is now a refugee camp. Civilians protest Midoriya's return until Uraraka pleads that heroes need protection too.<br><br>
                        
                        Midoriya's classmate Yuga Aoyama reveals himself to be a spy for All For One, but uses that connection to lure the Paranormal Liberation Front into a trap. Its remaining members are defeated by the heroes; Toga reciprocates Uraraka's sympathy before dying while saving the latter's life, as the Todoroki family subdues Dabi. All For One battles several heroes, including All Might using a powered suit, and his body is eventually destroyed by Bakugo. Shigaraki battles Midoriya and breaks free from All For One's control. Unable to defeat him physically, Midoriya transfers One For All to Shigaraki to damage him from within. All For One regains control, but is defeated by hero reinforcements; as the remnants of the past One For All wielders and Shigaraki rebel against him, Midoriya strikes the killing blow.<br><br>
                        
                        Eight years later, Midoriya has lost the power of One For All completely and become a teacher at U.A., while his former classmates have become Pro Heroes. All Might gives Midoriya a powered suit of his own, funded by his former classmates, which he uses to become a hero again.</p>
