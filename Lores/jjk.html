                    <h2><b><u>Plot:</u></b></h2>
                    <p>Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally physically strong high school student living in Sendai. In June 2018, before his grandfather dies, he instills two messages within Yuji: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people". Yuji's friends attract Curses to the school when they unseal a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect student Jujutsu Sorcerer Megumi Fushiguro, unwittingly becoming host to a powerful ancient sorcerer named Ryomen Sukuna. All sorcerers are required to exorcise Sukuna (and, by extension, Yuji) immediately. However, upon seeing Yuji surprisingly able to retain control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo, currently the strongest sorcerer in the modern world, brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School to train him as a sorcerer. He postpones Yuji's execution until he consumes all twenty of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be eliminated permanently with Yuji's death. Meanwhile, a group of intelligent Cursed Spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of Jujutsu sorcery, starting with sealing away Satoru Gojo to tip the balance of the world, as he is too strong to kill. led by mysterious sorcerer and curse user named Suguru Geto, who was supposed to have been killed by Gojo a year prior and now sports stitches on his forehead. His entourage includes the sadistic Mahito, fire Curse Jogo, and nature Curse Hanami.<br><br>

                        Gojo's class of first-years includes Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara Kugisaki. Part of their training is to go on missions to exorcise low-level curses, during which Sukuna takes an interest in Megumi, seeing his potential. Yuji is able to consume several of Sukuna's fingers while retaining his sense of self, impressing Gojo, and is also mentored by Gojo's colleague, first-grade sorcerer Kento Nanami. When his friend, a normal high school student named Junpei Yoshino, falls victim to Mahito's manipulations and is killed by him in front of Yuji, it marks a turning point for him, causing his first traumatic experience.<br><br>
                        
                        During a competition between the Tokyo and Kyoto Jujutsu schools, Cursed Spirits attack the students but the schools work together to fight them off. This turns out to be a distraction so Mahito can steal three "Death Paintings" (half-human half-Curses) from the Tokyo school, later summoning them to their full form. Yuji and Nobara kill two of the Death Paintings during a mission.<br><br>
                        
                        On Halloween 2018, Geto and the Cursed Spirits begin their ultimate plan by releasing several magical barriers over Shibuya to trap Gojo and normal civilians in. Though he puts up a fight and kills Hanami, Gojo is sealed away by Geto in the Prison Realm, a special artifact. The events reveal that the current Geto is not the original but rather Geto's corpse possessed by an ancient evil sorcerer named Kenjaku. Yuji and his allies face Kenjaku's forces in Shibuya to rescue Gojo but with Gojo gone, the Curses don't hold back, causing many casualties. Yuji faces Choso, the last and third Death Painting who fights him to avenge the killing of his brothers. Yuji is defeated, his life spared only due to Choso receiving a strange vision revealing that he and Yuji are also, in fact, brothers, related by blood. This causes him to switch loyalties, now siding with Yuji rather than Kenjaku. Jogo force-feeds an unconscious Yuji ten fingers at once, powering Sukuna enough to temporarily take over his body. Sukuna kills Jogo and battles Mahoraga, Megumi's most powerful and uncontrollable shikigami, causing Shibuya's near-destruction in the process.<br><br>
                        
                        Mahito kills Nanami and mortally wounds Nobara in front of Yuji to break him emotionally. With Todo's help, Yuji is able to defeat Mahito but is unable to stop Kenjaku from absorbing Mahito for his Cursed Technique. Kenjaku re-awakens countless new sorcerers throughout Japan that he had been planting for thousands of years, and unleashes a slew of Curses to usher in a world of Cursed Spirits reminiscent of the Heian period, the golden age of Jujutsu Sorcerers.<br><br>
                        
                        In the aftermath, the Jujutsu higher-ups reinstate Yuji's immediate execution, appointing second-year Yuta Okkotsu his executioner. Yuta, whose loyalty lies with Gojo, helps Yuji fake his death, and teams up with him, Megumi, and experienced sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo, along with Choso and second-year Maki Zen'in to meet Master Tengen, an immortal, part-Curse part-human sorcerer. Tengen reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge the former's consciousness with Japan's human population using "the Culling Games", a battle royale between all the awakened sorcerers to accumulate a massive amount of Cursed Energy to achieve this goal.<br><br>
                        
                        Maki is forced to kill her entire Zen'in clan when they lay a trap for her and kill her sister. Meanwhile, Yuji, Yuta, Megumi, second-year student Panda, and third-year student Kinji Hakari, seek out a mysterious woman named "Angel" who can free Gojo from the Prison Realm and help rescue Megumi's stepsister, Tsumiki, from participating in the Games. Kenjaku kills Yuki and captures Tengen. The group learns that Tsumiki has become a host for a reincarnated sorcerer, and Sukuna executes his ultimate plan: taking control of Megumi's body. He succeeds and kills Tsumiki to weaken Megumi's resolve. The main group uses Angel's power to free Gojo. Now unsealed, Gojo agrees to fight Sukuna on December 24.<br><br>
                        
                        Gojo faces off against Sukuna and Megumi's Ten Shadows but Sukuna emerges victorious, killing Gojo by slicing him in half. The rest of the sorcerers join in the battle as Sukuna revives himself to his true form. Meanwhile, Kenjaku is confronted by Fumihiko Takaba, a powerful sorcerer that proves an effective distraction, allowing Yuta to catch him off guard and decapitate him, though not before he adds a rule that allows Sukuna to become the Culling Games' master.<br><br>
                        
                        Yuta tells Sukuna he used Sukuna's last finger to copy his Cursed Technique. Maki, second year instructor Kusakabe, and Yuta's mentor Miguel all attempt to fight Sukuna, but all are overpowered. In a flashback, it is revealed that Sukuna ate his twin brother a thousand years ago in the womb because he was starving. Kenjaku then took the soul of Sukuna's twin brother and "made" Jin Itadori, Yuji's father, explaining why Yuji was able to contain Sukuna within him. This also makes Jin Sukuna's twin brother and Yuji his nephew. Choso sacrifices himself to protect Yuji.<br><br>
                        
                        Yuji and Todo overpower Sukuna, with Yuji impaling Sukuna's chest. As Sukuna attempts to use his Domain Expansion, he is stopped by Gojo's reappearance. However, Gojo is still dead; Yuta used Kenjaku's Cursed Technique to switch bodies with him. Yuji opens his own Domain Expansion; within it, he takes Sukuna on a journey through his hometown. Sukuna refuses to release Megumi; Yuji converses with Megumi's soul. Having been close to giving up, the conversation sparks Megumi's resolve to fight back. Sukuna realizes this and attempts to use his Domain Expansion. However, he realizes that one of the missing fingers on Yuji is not the one he took to possess Megumi. It is revealed that Yuta actually used one of Yuji's fingers instead. Meanwhile, Nobara arrives where Gojo hid Sukuna's last finger and uses it to attack Sukuna's soul. Yuji then lands a Black Flash on Sukuna, hitting his soul as well and turning the tide of the fight. Megumi frees himself from Sukuna as Yuji defeats him. He gives Sukuna one last chance, but Sukuna refuses and disintegrates away.<br><br>
                        
                        After the battle, Yuta is able to return to his own body again.</p>
