                    <h2><b><u>Plot:</u></b></h2>
                    <p>The story is set on a supercontinent version of Earth on which powerful monsters and supervillains wreak havoc. The millionaire Agoni creates the Hero Association, which employs superheroes to fight evil. Saitama, an unassociated hero, hails from City Z and performs heroic deeds as a hobby. For three years, he has trained enough to defeat any enemy with a single punch; his unmatched strength leaving him bored. He becomes a reluctant mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his hometown, after Saitama defeats the monster Mosquito Girl that defeated Genos.<br><br>

                        Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association, hoping to attain notability, but Genos instantly obtains an S-Class rank. Due to scoring low on the written exam despite having a perfect score on the physical exam, Saitama only becomes a C-Class hero. His feats remain unnoticed even after saving people from an asteroid and then the Deep Sea King, barely getting himself promoted to B-Class with help from Mumen Rider. Later, shortly before her death, the seer Shibabawa predicts that the world is in great danger as the alien Boros invades the planet. The heroes kill the invaders and destroy Boros's ship as Saitama defeats Boros in single combat.<br><br>
                        
                        Monsters begin appearing faster while the rogue martial artist Garo, a former apprentice of the hero Bang, and self-dubbed "Hero Hunter," begins terrorizing heroes. Due to childhood bullying, he holds a grudge against everything "heroic". The heroes learn that the monster influx comes from the Monster Association, an organization of monsters under City Z intent on destroying the Hero Association. They attack various cities, recruit fighters by offering them "Monster Cells" that mutate humans into monsters, and kidnap a Hero Association executive's son. Garo bonds with Tareo, a child who idolizes heroes, as he hunts down more heroes, his combat prowess slowly rising. The Monster Association attempts to recruit him and kidnaps the child when Garo refuses. He storms the Monster Association HQ trying to rescue the child, but ultimately gets captured.<br><br>
                        
                        The Hero Association assaults the headquarters to rescue the executive's son, causing a battle that destroys City Z and kills almost every monster. Saitama meets the highest-ranked hero Blast during the raid when he arrives to collect artifacts, who warns him of a threat known as "God". Many heroes are heavily injured when Garo emerges, mutated into a monster from the fighting. Unable to match the power of Saitama, Garo receives some of "God's" power when he meets it in a vision, causing him to emit radiation that kills all the heroes, including Genos by ripping out his core to get Saitama to fight him seriously. He briefly matches Saitama in a brutal battle that sends them across the Solar System. After Saitama defeats him, Garo becomes distraught over Tareo's death and teaches Saitama to time travel before God kills him. Saitama goes back in time and subdues Garo before he kills the heroes, destroying his monster mutation and cosmic power. Despite the objections of the other heroes, Saitama spares Garo and lets him flee after Tareo stops them. Only Genos, who reconnected with his core from the original timeline bought by Saitama (who seemed to remember nothing of his battle and time travel with the original Garo), remembers the entire events of the original ominous future caused by Garou.<br><br>
                        
                        With the Monster Association destroyed, Saitama gets promoted to A-Class for defeating Garo. As the battle destroyed his apartment, he relocates to the Hero Association's HQ in A-City. The Hero Association's poor performance causes public opinion of them to plummet. Several heroes and officials decide to retire or defect to the Neo Heroes, a rival group appearing to be more effective in handling the growing monster threats.<br><br>
                        
                        Leading it is the hero Blue, who claims to be the son of Blast. However, Neo Heroes has even worse shady activities on turning many of its members and other people outside the organization, including Hero Association members into cyborg slaves, and possibly connected to Genos' past and even Bofoi. On the same day, Genos received a final upgrade from Kuseno and Saitama's power level is being studied at a capsule; Kuseno's unexpected assassination at the hands of robot assassins was just a beginning of the robot invasion.</p>

                    <p>One-Punch Man is a Japanese superhero manga series created by One.
