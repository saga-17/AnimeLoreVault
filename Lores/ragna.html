                    <h2><b><u>Plot:</u></b></h2>
                    <p>When Ragna was 3-years-old, his parents were killed and eaten by Dragons. Later, when some of his relatives took him in they were also devoured. After that he was sold to a wealthy family only for their mansion to be burned down by Dragons.<br><br>

                        All these horrible events would ultimately lead to Ragna earning the reputation of being cursed or even working for the Dragons.<br><br>
                        
                        One day, while he was being beaten by Sykes Charluke and his goons because one of his family mansions got burned down, he was rescued by Leonica who invited him to hunt Dragons due to her seeing a hidden strength in him for always surviving tragedies and because him attracting Dragons could help in hunting.<br><br>
                        
                        While Ragna tried to warn her Leonica simply explained to him that only those who are stronger than Dragons can survive and that she would prove that to him.<br><br>
                        
                        In the following years the pair would hunt Dragons. Well, technically, Leonica was the one mainly hunting whereas Ragna took care of everything outside the hunting.<br><br>
                        
                        While Ragna believed he would never reach Leonica's level of power that never stopped him from training in secret so he could stay with her as long as possible, at least until the day he himself would be killed by a Dragon.
                    
                        One day, while hunting, Ragna daydreamed someone killing instantly countless dragons of many sizes, but this got him distracted and almost killed by a dragon if it wasn't for Leonica's intervention. They returned to the hunter guild in Ronabera, one of the seven cities of the Kingdom of Lese, to redeem the bounty. At the guild's tavern Ragna gets harassed by Sykes and his goons because of his weakness but Leonica intervened by drawing out her silver sword. Leo questioned Sykes what he sought with his sword, she explained she sought only strength and that was the reason she hunted dragon, because they are the strongest creatures she could fight. Then she invited anyone to follow her on her journey dedicated to onloy hunt dragons, she would share with them wealth, fame and glory, but no one showed interest except Ragna. Afterwards they went to sleep. While Leo was sleeping, Ragna was secretly training as he always did. He knew he would never reach Leonica's strength even in a lifetime but what he sought was to hunt with Leo until the day he would inevitably die by a dragon. But his thought is suddenly interrupted by another daydream which reminded him what he wishes will never happen followed by a vision of Leonica saving him but dying in the process.<br><br>
                    
                        Five days later, March 26th, at the hunter guild, Ragna and Leo overhear Sykes who noticed the weird movements of the dragons in the region which are all directed to Donapierru. Ragna, extremely tired after having the same nightmare every single day, didn't reply to Leonica comment on Donapierru famous cakeshop. Leo realized something was wrong and questioned him what the problem was, Ragna asked her how he could be a source of strength to her, and she replied when they meet for the first time, she recognized in him her same potential. Ragna stated he didn't have her same talent and Leo agreed with him, but her genius intuition told her he would one day become very strong, but she didn't know when that would happen and until then she would protect him. Ragna then succumbed to his tiredness between Leo's arms.<br><br>
                    
                        The evening after came the news that Donapierru was destroyed by the dragons to the surprise of everyone because the city was known as "the city who needs no dragon hunters" as it was never attacked for decades. Ragna paled to this news and tried to convince Leo to run away but before he could explain the reason he was interrupted when the dragons attacked Ronabera. When the responsible of the attack, a superior dragon, showed up, Ragna tried to ambush him but failed miserably. Ragna fell in the city's river after the dragon counterattack, while unconscious he started seeing more dreams of himself who after losing Leo started a reckless revenge to hunt every single dragon. He fought and reached the limit of his potential, but it wasn't enough. He got companions but they died. So, he kept fighting to hit utmost limits and beyond. Ragna then realized the author of these dreams was no one other than himself from the future. Future Ragna revealed himself and showed disgust for his past self because he worshipped Leonica as a hero and wallowed in her strength but if he really cared he should have become the strongest to protect her from any harm. Future Ragna finally got the power, but no one was left to protect. Ragna demanded him to give this power to him as he needed it, and his future self didn't anymore and so his future self assured him that was his intention from the start. Ragna started experiencing an extremely painful transfer of power shortly after he was saved from drowning in the river by Sykes.<br><br>

                        Ragna woke up awakened, in one instant he killed all the dragons attacking Sykes and his group. Ragna learned how when he started his revenge in the future, he threw himself in battle and nearly died many times, continued to survive and repeated it over and over. Initially he always lost but slowly his victories started to accumulate until he always won. He continued for 10 years until his silver sword started to fuse with him, but he ignored it as it didn't interfere with his hunting even though the pain was excruciating; 5 years later the sword completely fused with him, making his very flesh a weapon that exuded silver aura; 3 years after that, Ragna would learned how to amplify his body's aura; and 4 years later, he learned how to freely manipulate the silver aura on his own. During this period, Ragna went above and beyond the limits of a human and, after another 10 years of training, would master the ultimate dragon slaying technique, the "Silverine Battle Arts".<br><br>

                        Ragna approached the superior dragon Grymwelte, who was going to kill Leonica. Grymwelte was trembling by his presence and tried to use his full magic power to kill him but he was shattered in pieces in one instant by him. Ragna, still having the terrible memories of his future, saw Leonica was still alive and cried of joy until he fell asleep between her arms.<br><br>

                        Ragna woke up from a nightmare and found he was sleeping in a bed with Leonica, when he saw she was still alive he felt emotional again. Shortly after Sykes entered the room and explained him they were in his mansion and only because their inn was burned down and Leo asked him. Sykes then explained the actual situation, all the remaining dragons flew away after the superior dragon death, but half of the city was already destroyed, and the dead are countless, so he asked Ragna on what to do now and he replied they should leave the country because the Dragon God declared the end of the kingdom, so they won't be followed beyond the border. Sykes was shocked by his reply and questioned him if he was really the Ragna he knew, but before he could answer Leo woke up; Ragna, seeing her alive and moving, cried until he fell asleep again.<br><br>

                        Ragna woke up to Leonica's screams and immediately froze all the tree-dragons surrounding them who just attacked Sykes' mansion. Immediately after he run away to where the dragons were coming meanwhile Leo tried to catch up to his speed but failed. Ragna reprimanded himself for lowering his guard after saving Leo the day before knowing very well that the danger has not passed yet. In a short time he reached Temruogtaf, the superior dragon responsible of the attack, and with a drop kick the dragon was propelled away just before a human maid serving the superior dragon was eaten by him. Only after the attack, Ragna realized he saved someone and immediately recognized them but before he could continue Temruogtaf intervened. The dragon was enraged by the attack and pretended Ragna should turn off his silver aura and he obeyed. The dragon didn't waste a second and attacked him thinking he was able to outsmart him but in a fraction of a second Ragna created a silver aura bomb and made him ate it. The bomb detonated and froze and killed every dragon, the forest of dragons included.<br><br>

                        Leo, arrived shortly after, remarked his speed and congratulated him for his new strength, just like her genius intuition told her before. Ragna requested her to bring all the survivors beyond the border while he would remain for more dangerous work but she immediately refused because she didn't want to separate from him. Leo ended up in a childish rant and only then he realized Leo was still just a child. He recognized her strength, instincts and insight but she was a child which had always to be stronger than she needed because of his weakness. Ragna reminded her their first meeting and her statement on the strong and regretfully decided to separate from her because now she was too weak. Leo tried childishly to attack Ragna but she got knocked out in one instant by him.<br><br>

                        Now far away, Ragna brought with him the maid. The maid asked him if he was alright and Ragna replied that only those whose death he doesn't care or those who can't die could follow him. The maid was confused by his reply, Ragna asked her if she was the one who sought him and then he realized their meeting was a coincidence. Ragna called out his name, Crimson the former progenitor of the Winged Bloodline, and asked for help to hunt all the dragons. The maid, confused again, tried to introduce herself as Elise Yorkshire but Ragna cut her in the middle and completed her introduction and explained that future Crimson already told him everything, they both fought together against the dragons in the future. Ragna invited Crimson to use him again to exterminate all dragons as this time they'll be successful but he was only met by a slap on the face as she found his manners rude and offensive to accuse her to be a dragon.<br><br>

                        Ragna was originally a very weak Dragon Hunter who followed the hunter prodigy, Leonica. Not wanting to be a burden for her, Ragna secretly trained so that he could one day protect Leonica instead of her always defending him. However, during one of these sessions, Ragna would not only experience a prophetic dream which told him of a Dragon attack that would lead to the death of Leonica, but he would also gain the power of his future self who'd trained for years to vanquish all Dragons.<br><br>
                        
                        After managing to stop the future tragedy, Ragna came to the conclusion that in order for him to become stronger he would need to leave behind Leonica. Shortly after this decision, he would meet his greatest ally in the future, the cunning and equally vengeful Crimson, and they depart on their journey to exterminate the Dragon race.
